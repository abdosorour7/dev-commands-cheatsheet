## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a clean static architecture with no framework and no build requirement.

- **`index.html`**: page shell and semantic structure
- **`assets/css/styles.css`**: visual design, layout, responsive styles
- **`assets/data/commands.en.json`**: English command data (canonical source of truth)
- **`assets/data/commands.it.json`**: Italian translations
- **`assets/data/commands.fr.json`**: French translations
- **`assets/data/commands.es.json`**: Spanish translations
- **`assets/data/commands.zh-CN.json`**: Simplified Chinese translations
- **`assets/data/ui.json`**: all UI strings keyed by locale (`en`, `it`, `fr`, `es`)
- **`assets/js/app.js`**: app bootstrap and orchestration
- **`assets/js/modules/`**:
  - `data-loader.js` for data fetching (accepts a `lang` param, loads `commands.{lang}.json`)
  - `render.js` for UI rendering
  - `state.js` for filtering/state logic
  - `interactions.js` for copy, keyboard, and scroll behavior
  - `i18n.js` for language switching, UI string application, and `localStorage` persistence

This keeps the app easy to maintain, easy to extend, and contributor-friendly.

> **Adding a new language:** create `assets/data/commands.{lang}.json` (translate `title`, `searchDescription`, and `descriptionHtml` fields — leave `command`, `key`, `icon`, `color`, `codeHtml` as-is), add the locale's UI strings to `assets/data/ui.json`, add the language code to `SUPPORTED_LANGS`, and add a button to the `#lang-switcher` in `index.html`. Translation files can be partial: any missing commands automatically fall back to English at runtime.

### ➕ Adding a new command

1. Add the command to `assets/data/commands.en.json` (required, source of truth).
2. Optionally add translated entries in `assets/data/commands.fr.json`, `assets/data/commands.it.json`, `assets/data/commands.es.json`, and `assets/data/commands.zh-CN.json` in the same PR.
3. If translations are not added yet, the command still appears in localized views with an `EN` badge until translated.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1 — Use the live website
Just visit: **[abdosorour7.github.io/git-commands-cheatsheet](https://abdosorour7.github.io/git-commands-cheatsheet)**

### Option 2 — Run locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdosorour7/git-commands-cheatsheet.git
cd git-commands-cheatsheet
```

Open `index.html` first (double-click it, or open it in your browser).

If the page works, you are done.

If commands do not load (browser blocks `file://` JSON loading), run a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open: **http://localhost:8080**

If Python is not installed, use one of these alternatives:

```bash
# Option A (Node.js)
npx serve .

# Option B (VS Code extension)
Use "Live Server" and open the project root
```

You can still open `index.html` directly, but some browsers may block local JSON loading over `file://`.

No build tools required for local development.
